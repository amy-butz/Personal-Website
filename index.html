        <b>Who are you?</b><br><br>
        My name is Amy Butz....yes, Butz. Only true love would have convinced me to take on such a name. But fall in love I did,
        and a league of doughty men and women bravely carried on the name before me, so who was I to refuse? The point is, don't
        make fun of my name, but you can call me Butz if you want to. I don't mind.</p> 
      <p><b>What are you interested in?</b><br><br>
        ALL THE THINGS! Seriously, life is so freaking interesting! But if I have to narrow it down to a few:</p>
      <ul><li>Reading and books. Specifically fantasy, Brit Lit, sci-fi, and classics.</li>
          <li>Social media and its role in: entrepreneurship, social change, building (or damaging) communities, and sharing memes.</li>
        <li>Singing along with the radio in the car. Seriously, it is my favorite.</li>
        <li>Memes and animated Gifs. They are my love language.</li>
        <li>Chips & Queso, obviously.</li></ul>
      <p><b>What are you doing to learn to code?</b><br><br>
        Well first and foremost, participating in the WebDev track of the 20Serpentine, sorry, 2017 CoderGirl Cohort. Googling about
        eleventy-hundred times a day to remember what I used to know about coding. That's about it so far, it is early days for me.
