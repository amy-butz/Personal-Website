        Hello. My name is Amy, and I have been a web developer-in-progress since 1998. Only recently did
        I decide to pivot towards an actual career in tech. I am currently participating in the CoderGirl
        program through <a href="https://www.launchcode.org" target="_blank">LaunchCode</a>. At CoderGirl, I am honing my skills in HTML and CSS, and I have been
        learning JavaScript, jQuery, React, Bootstrap, and more. <br><br>

        Apart from web development, my other passions include my husband and two kids, caring for my house plants,
        <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/amymbutz" target="_blank">reading</a>, Instagram, The Missouri Botanical Garden,
        good design, theatre, wilderness, and daydreaming. I also work with 
        <a href="http://angelbandproject.org/" target="_blank">The Angel Band Project</a>, an advocacy organization for raising awareness of sexual violence and supporting
        resources that bring healing to survivors.<br><br>
