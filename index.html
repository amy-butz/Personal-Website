        Hello. My name is Amy, and I have been a web developer-in-progress since 1998. Only recently did
        I decide to pivot towards an actual career in tech. I am currently participating in the CoderGirl
        program, through LaunchCode. At CoderGirl, I am honing my skills in html and css, and I have been
        learning javascript, jquery, react, bootstrap, and more. <br><br>

        Apart from web development, my other passions are my husband and two kids, reading fiction, Instagram, 
        Costco, good design, theatre, having lengthy debates in my head, and daydreaming.<br><br>

        You can see the projects I have been working on at <a href="https://github.com/amy-butz" target="_blank">
        my GitHub account</a>.
