        <p>Oh hey!
            I should probably tell you at the outset that until a couple of weeks ago, I was not looking for a new job.
            I have a pretty good gig with people I enjoy at a major telecommunications company using an excellent tech
            stack. But you know that thing when you are on the internet, and one click leads to another?
            One minute you are trying to pay your gas bill, and somehow twenty minutes later you are researching how to
            hike the <span class="italic">Camino de Santiago</span>? That's what happened to me a couple of weeks ago, when I randomly saw a post about
            Automattic while scrolling on LinkedIn. Something about that post jumped out at me, and I have learned to pay attention
            to my gut. Next thing I know, I am listening to "The Year without Pants" on Audible, designing a new WordPress blog for
            myself, scanning Automattic's job postings, and sliding into the Twitter DMs of the only Automattician in my home
            city. (Thanks Ryan Markel!)
        </p>
        <p>
            I can be very enthusiastic when something grabs hold of me.
        </p>
        <p>
            The more I learned about the culture at Automattic, the more I eagerly wanted to be a part of it! Working
            remotely? YES, that would be absolutely amazing, particularly as a parent. The travel? HECK YES, I want to travel to
            new and exciting places! Who wouldn't? But those perks are not really the heart of the matter - the things that I've
            gleaned from what I now know about Automattic that I deeply respect and want to be a part of are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You trust and respect your employees.</li>
            <li>You keep things simple and eschew anything that complicates or blocks greatness.</li>
            <li>Much of the internet has been overwhelmed by shallow, impulsive, and even toxic communication;
                Automattic provides a platform for the best of what the internet can be.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I also began to re-evaluate this "great job" that I currently have. While there is much to recommend it and
            I am grateful for the employment, I realized that I need not settle for the conventional. Why start now?! I have never
            been one to stick to the conventional. My "career" started with two years in a Carmelite monastery, giving the whole
            simplicity and meditation thing a try. From there my job titles and roles have included camp counselor, environmental advocate, doula
            (aka childbirth assistant), blogger, independent sales consultant, insurance customer service representative, and finally
            software developer. (Also, throw wife and mom in there.) It's been a wild ride. </p>
        <p>
            <strong>In all of it, the three through-lines of my life have been a love of people, a love of technology, and a love of words.</strong>
            The job of a Happiness Engineer at Automattic brings all three of them together in a way that is just so perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
            And now, because there are few things that I love more than following directions and checking things off
            lists:
        <ol>
            <li>
                While customer service is not something I have admittedly done a lot of reading on specifically, a
                c ouple ofthings do jump to mind. I have read Delivering Happiness, by Tony Hsieh. I found it to be insightful in
                such a way that with every point he made, I found myself thinking, “of course this is true! It’s obvious!
                Finding your passion, remaining focused on what you are good at, treating your employees right…and most
                importantly, focusing on the happiness of your customers…of course these things lead to success!” And yet, if his
                conclusions are so obvious, why do they seem to elude so many businesses? Secondly, I had to hunt it down
                with Google, but I recently came across <a href=https://www.cheatsheet.com/money-career/costco-best-customer-service-america.html/" target="_blank">
                this article about the reasons that Costco gets such high marks in customer service</a>. Again, their approach
                makes so much sense – and there seems to be a good deal of overlap between what Costco does right, what Hsieh
                recommends, and what Automattic stands for.
            </li>

            <li>Probably the best customer service experience I’ve had in recent memory was with T-Mobile, my mobile
                phone provider. Without going into the nitty gritty of our situation, over the span of a couple of weeks, I engaged with
                customer service representatives, both by chat and by phone, first to upgrade our data plan and then to revert it back to
                our previous plan when it turned out the new plan did not serve our needs. Throughout the whole experience, every agent I
                spoke with was genuinely friendly and amiable, and seemed to be enjoying themselves. They answered all of my questions
                with clarity and patience. And when we wanted to go back to our old, less expensive plan (which was technically no longer
                offered by the company), our request was honored with zero pushback. Since those experiences, I have been singing
                T-Mobile’s praises, and would be hard pressed to be enticed away from their service.
            </li>

            <li>I am not kidding or exaggerating when I say that “Never Stop Learning” is my <span class="italic">raison d'etre</span>. Curiosity
                about the world has been my default posture since I was a child. I always loved school; at university, I was a
                double-major and a double-minor because I wanted to learn All The Things. By the time graduation rolled around, I’d had my fill of
                formal education (at least for a while) but I never once considered my life as a student to be complete. I continue to
                bootstrap my own education on a daily basis through reading, podcasts, documentaries, and whatever resources I can find
                online. A lot of the time I like to glean from a variety of domains of knowledge, until something grabs me. In that case,
                I’ll deep dive on a topic for days, weeks, even months at a time. Sometimes there are practical or professional
                benefits to what I learn; my 9 months with LaunchCode produced a successful and lucrative career pivot! Knowledge gained and put
                to good use for the betterment of individuals and society is the best kind of learning. Yet I am also a fan of speculative
                pursuits and the pure pleasure of learning. “Knowledge for its own sake” is not a condemnation in my book.
